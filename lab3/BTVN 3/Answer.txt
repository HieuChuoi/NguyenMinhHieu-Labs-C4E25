_ We use function to reuse the code
_ To define a function we use: def
   ex: def <function_name> (function_parameter):
_ To call a function: function_name(parameter)
_ The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller
_ Yes. We have to use return in every function
_Python allows functions to be called using keyword arguments
When we call functions in this way, the order (position) of the arguments can be changed.
Following calls to the above function are all valid and produce the same result 
_ We have 2 ways to use a function from a different file:
1. use: imoprt <file_name>
2. use: from <file_name> import <function_name>
